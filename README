Speech Segmentation Assignment:

Files Overview
 1. 1_extract_audio.py - Extracts audio from video/audio files
 2. 2_detect_speech_timestamps.py - Detects when people are speaking
 3. 3_segment_audio.py - Creates individual audio clips for each segment

How to Run (In Sequence)
Step 1: Extract Audio
bashpython 1_extract_audio.py

Input: test_audio.wav (or any video/audio file)
Output: output/extracted_audio.wav

Step 2: Detect Speech Timestamps
bashpython 2_detect_speech_timestamps.py

Input: output/extracted_audio.wav
Output: output/speech_segments.json

Step 3: Segment Audio
bashpython 3_segment_audio.py

Input: output/extracted_audio.wav + output/speech_segments.json
Output: output/segments/segment_01.wav, segment_02.wav, etc.
